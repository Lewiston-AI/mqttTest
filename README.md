# mqttTest
A simple mqtt broker publisher and subscriber.

This application requires you have access to a running MQTT Broker. This has been tested against a HiveMQ broker. The application can run as a publisher and subscriber. You can also run as separate publisher and subscriber; two processes and marginally more interesting.

Configuration is loaded via a json file. The json format is output in the help (-h).
